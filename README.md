# Blockchain Tickets
The ability to produce, store and create festival, concert and tickets in general on the blockchain

But what about what Stubhub does?

The ability to have used/second-hand festival and concert tickets 'sold' via the blockchain somehow, with original "ownership" transferred via NFT token/smart contract

Issuing new Singles/Albums via the blockchain, and storing them on there as well

Transferring large amounts of data/info onto the blockchain and storing it/them there, example(s) being Spotify, etc.
